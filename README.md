# -Predicting-airline-ticket-prices
This project focuses on forecasting the prices of airline tickets. Airline ticket prices are highly dynamic and can fluctuate based on various factors such as demand, seasonality, flight routes, booking time, and airline policies. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the future prices of tickets, helping travelers make informed decisions on the best time to purchase.

By analyzing historical data on ticket prices, passenger demand, and other relevant variables, machine learning algorithms such as regression models, decision trees, or neural networks can be used to identify patterns and trends in pricing. The project aims to create a predictive system that can offer real-time price predictions for different flight routes, providing significant value to both consumers and airline companies in optimizing pricing strategies.
