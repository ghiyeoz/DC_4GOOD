# Child Wellbeing Analysis

Welcome to the Child Wellbeing Analysis project! This repository contains an analysis of child wellbeing indicators using SQL queries. The project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting child wellbeing and offer data-driven recommendations for improvement.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a dataset that includes information on various indicators related to child wellbeing. The dataset contains the following tables:

- `child`: Contains data about children, including their demographics and health-related information.
- `family`: Includes data about families, such as income, household composition, and parental characteristics.
- `education`: Provides information about the educational background of parents.
- `neighborhood`: Contains data about the neighborhood characteristics, such as crime rates and access to amenities.
- `childcare`: Includes information about childcare arrangements and their impact on child wellbeing.

## Analysis

The analysis covers the following aspects of child wellbeing:

1. Demographic Analysis: Investigating the impact of demographics on child wellbeing, including age, gender, and race/ethnicity.

2. Socioeconomic Analysis: Exploring the relationship between socioeconomic factors, such as family income, parental education, and child wellbeing indicators.

3. Family Structure Analysis: Analyzing the influence of family structure, including single-parent households and household size, on child wellbeing.

4. Neighborhood Analysis: Examining the impact of neighborhood characteristics, such as crime rates, poverty levels, and access to education and healthcare, on child wellbeing.

5. Childcare Analysis: Investigating the effects of different childcare arrangements, such as home-based or center-based care, on child wellbeing outcomes.

## Queries

The project includes a set of Python script that demonstrate the analysis performed on the dataset. The pandas code cover a range of topics and provide insights into the relationships between different variables and child wellbeing indicators. Examples of query topics include:

- Calculating average child wellbeing scores by age group or race/ethnicity.
- Analyzing the correlation between parental education level and child health outcomes.
- Investigating the impact of neighborhood crime rates on child development indicators.
- Comparing child wellbeing scores between different types of childcare arrangements.
